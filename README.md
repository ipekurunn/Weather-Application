# Weather App - Website
## Project Description
In this project, a Weather Application has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API is made accessible to users. Our website displays crucial weather information such as Temperature, Weather Conditions, Humidity, and Wind Speed, specific to different cities.

## Features
* Dynamic Data Display: Using JavaScript, we dynamically present current weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap's Free API on our website.
